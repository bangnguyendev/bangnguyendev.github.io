[C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-programming-language/) is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.

<!-- Hello world! Posts -->
<h1 class="text-center">Hello world!</h1>
<div class="spacer"></div>

{% highlight c linenos %}
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   // printf() displays the string inside quotation
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on C language. [C++](https://www.scaler.com/topics/cpp/) is nearly a superset of C language (There are few programs that may compile in C, but not in C++).

-   Structured language
    -   It has the ability to divide and hide all the information and instruction.
    -   Code can be partitioned in C using functions or code block.
    -   C is a well structured language compare to other.
-   General purpose language
    -   Make it ideal language for system programming.
    -   It can also be used for business and scientific application.
    -   ANSI established a standard for c in 1983.
    -   The ability of c is to manipulate bits,byte and addresses.
    -   It is adopted in later 1990.
-   Portability
    -   Portability is the ability to port or use the software written .
    -   One computer C program can be reused.
    -   By modification or no modification.
-   Code Re-usability & Ability to customize and extend
    -   A programmer can easily create his own function
    -   It can can be used repeatedly in different application
    -   C program basically collection of function
    -   The function are supported by 'c' library
    -   Function can be added to 'c' library continuously
-   Limited Number of Key Word
    -   There are only 32 keywords in 'C'
    -   27 keywords are given by ritchie
    -   5 is added by ANSI
    -   The strength of 'C' is lies in its in-built function
    -   Unix system provides as large number of C function
    -   Some function are used in operation .
    -   Other are for specialized in their application
