I am currently taking on the role of a Project Team Leader as well as a person who is passionate about teaching. **I want to share my knowledge and experience with those who love embedded programming.**

In this article, I will introduce the work of a Project Team Leader, the skills and qualities needed to become an effective leader.

I will also share about **my learning and working process** in the field of embedded programming, **as well as the teaching activities that I participate in**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Work of a Team Leader Project

By definition, a Project Team Leader is the person who leads and directly manages a specific team within a project. This is an important position that helps the whole team to operate effectively and achieve the set goals.

Some of the main tasks of a Project Team Leader include:

- Planning, assigning and tracking the progress of the team members' work.
- Supporting, guiding and solving any issues that arise during the project implementation.
- Ensuring the quality and standards of the product or service delivered.
- Communicating and reporting to the client, supervisor and other stakeholders about the project status.
- Encouraging, motivating and building team spirit.

### ‚öôÔ∏è My learning and working process in the field of embedded programming

I started learning embedded programming when I was a sophomore. I taught myself through books, videos and blogs about embedded programming. I also participated in clubs and competitions related to this field.

After graduating, I worked on projects related to embedded programming at different companies.

**In the last 5 years, the projects that I have been involved in are:**

- 2020: I worked on the MCAL project [Renesas MCAL \| Renesas](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/software-tool/renesas-mcal) at Renesas VN with modules such as PORT, GPT, SPI, ... for embedded chips here.

- 2021-2022: I was transferred to the car airbag project [Airbag control unit (bosch-mobility.com)](https://www.bosch-mobility.com/en/solutions/control-units/airbag-control-unit/) at BOSCH.

- 2022-present: I am currently the Team Leader for the RZG team [RZ/G Series (Linux-based MPU) \| Renesas](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/rz-mpus/rzg-series) Onsite at Renesas VN.

During my work, I have accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience in embedded programming. I have learned how to use common tools and programming languages in this field, such as C/C++, Python, STM32, ... 
I have also become familiar with different types of chips, boards and sensors. 
I have had the opportunity to work with customers from different countries (Japan, China, India, ...).

### ‚öôÔ∏è The teaching activities that I participated in

Besides working at the company, I also have a passion for teaching. I want to share my knowledge and experience with those who love embedded programming.

Every day, after work, I also tutor some kids who study at Vinschool. **I teach them the basics of embedded programming through lectures and practical exercises.** I also encourage them to freely create products using embedded programming. **Their final results are very good.**

On weekends, I usually organize an embedded programming class for those who want to **improve their knowledge** or **prepare for a new job related to embedded programming**. I am happy to help them understand more about the basic concepts, programming languages, tools and devices needed to implement embedded programming projects. I also often assign them practical exercises so they can apply what they have learned to reality.

My passion is programming and creating products using programming that have `high practical applications`. 
I have participated in many projects related to embedded programming, such as designing a smart control system for motorcycles, developing energy management software for electronic devices, or `building IoT applications` for smart devices. 
I always try to learn and update the latest technologies in this field to be able to create quality and efficient products.
